# ReFactorium
Mindustry Mod.
## Current additions
#### Scrap
* Now it's more useful - you can put it in the core and build walls and other buildings with it.
#### Condenser
* Simple free water source.
#### Scrabbler
* Small drill made out of scrap.
#### Shredder
* Small turret made out of scrap. Consumes scrap.
#### Sieve
* Processes sand and outputs scrap.
## Known Issues
* Condenser requires power (single solar panel is enough for any amount of these). Cannot be fixed currently due to game itself.
## TODO
* Thorns made of scrap that damage enemies walking on them.
* Polluted water. Can be crafted using Spores and Water. Can be obtained by pumping polluted water.
* Filter that clears water and outputs thorium.
* Bottles that can be filled with liquids and emptied later.
